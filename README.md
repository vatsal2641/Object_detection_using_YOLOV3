# Object_detection_using_YOLOV3
YOLO V3 is a state of art object detection algorithm used for detecting objects in real time.
YOLO v3 is the third version of the YOLO object detection algorithm. It was introduced in 2018 as an improvement over YOLO v2, aiming to increase the accuracy and speed of the algorithm.
One of the main improvements in YOLO v3 is the use of a new CNN architecture called Darknet-53. Darknet-53 is a variant of the ResNet architecture and is designed specifically for object detection tasks. It has 53 convolutional layers and is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on various object detection benchmarks.

This project's is built using streamlit. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build interactive web applications and dashboards for machine learning and data science projects.
